Generating structured data from unstructured inputs is one of the core use cases for AI. Recent release from OpenAI has introduced a new [Structured Outputs](https://openai.com/index/introducing-structured-outputs-in-the-api/) feature that allows you to generate JSONs with a given schema. While it promises guarantees of correctness, I was curious to see how well it performs and what are the caveats.

In this post, I benchmark two different OpenAI models across three different methods of JSON generation and analyze the results focusing on error rates, performance and costs.

> **Disclaimer:** This is not a comprehensive benchmark, but rather a quick experiment that aimed to answer a specific question. Most importantly, it's not focusing on the accuracy of the generated data, but rather on the performance of the LLMs.

## Experiment Setup

Task: Generate a JSON object adhering to the schema provided. Think of mocking data for a database.

I tested six LLM configurations across three JSON schema generation methods:

1. `gpt-4o-mini` generating JSONs using Tool Calls
2. `gpt-4o-mini` generating JSONs using JSON mode
3. `gpt-4o-mini` generating JSONs using JSON mode using `strict = True`
4. `gpt-4o-2024-08-06` generating JSONs using Tool Calls
5. `gpt-4o-2024-08-06` generating JSONs using JSON mode
6. `gpt-4o-2024-08-06` generating JSONs using JSON mode using `strict = True`

And three JSON schema complexities:

1. **Wide JSON**: 25 fields with 1 level of nesting
2. **Complex JSON**: 25 fields with 5 levels of nesting
3. **Super Complex JSON**: 100 fields with 5 levels of nesting

## Key Findings

### Strict vs Non-Strict: A Performance Showdown

Our benchmark revealed interesting insights into the performance differences between strict and non-strict modes across various JSON complexities:

#### Wide JSON Schema

In the simplest scenario, non-strict modes generally outperformed their strict counterparts:

- The fastest performer was `gpt-4o-mini` with tool calls (2943.3405 ms)
- `gpt-4o-mini` in Strict Mode was significantly slower (4530.8732 ms)
- `gpt-4o-2024-08-06` in Strict Mode (3852.8140 ms) was outpaced by its non-strict counterparts (3149.5288 ms with tool calls, 4065.5266 ms for JSON generation)

However, all configurations achieved a 100% success rate, **indicating that strictness might be overkill for simple structures.**

#### Complex JSON Schema

As complexity increased, the performance gap narrowed:

- `gpt-4o-2024-08-06` with tool calls led (4079.0854 ms)
- `gpt-4o-2024-08-06` in Strict Mode followed closely (5866.2200 ms)
- Notably, `gpt-4o-mini` with tool calls failed completely, while its strict counterpart succeeded

This suggests that strictness becomes more valuable as JSON complexity increases, especially for less advanced models.

#### Super Complex JSON Schema

In the most challenging scenario, strict modes shined:

- `gpt-4o-2024-08-06` in Strict Mode was the top performer
- Both non-strict tool methods failed entirely
- Strict JSON methods maintained 100% success rates
- Surprisingly, smaller model in strict mode was even slower than the bigger model in strict mode

This underscores the critical importance of strictness in handling highly complex JSON structures.

### The Cold Start in Strict Mode

As [Ted Sanders](https://x.com/sandersted) mentioned in [this HN comment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41174306), using strict mode bears a significant cold start penalty which goes away in the subsequent runs.

> The first request with each JSON schema will be slow, as we need to preprocess the JSON schema into a context-free grammar. If you don't want that latency hit (e.g., you're prototyping, or have a use case that uses variable one-off schemas), then you might prefer "strict": false

How much slower it is? Here are my results:

| Model             | schema                    | avgFirstRequestTime | avgSecondRequestTime | coldStartPenalty |
| ----------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------- |
| gpt-4o-2024-08-06 | Wide JSON Schema          | 20234.0549          | 5927.3556            | 241.37%          |
| gpt-4o-mini       | Wide JSON Schema          | 21801.5501          | 5800.8192            | 275.84%          |
| gpt-4o-2024-08-06 | Complex JSON Schema       | 24089.9075          | 7100.4283            | 239.27%          |
| gpt-4o-mini       | Complex JSON Schema       | 26665.4039          | 10270.7880           | 159.62%          |
| gpt-4o-2024-08-06 | Super Complex JSON Schema | 60481.4465          | 11698.9430           | 416.98%          |
| gpt-4o-mini       | Super Complex JSON Schema | 66011.3763          | 13994.1616           | 371.71%          |

The more complex the JSON schema, the more painful the cold start penalty becomes.

### Strictness and Cost: An Unexpected Relationship

Interestingly, the impact of strictness on cost varied between model versions:

- For the `gpt-4o-mini` model, strict mode was generally cheaper (e.g., $0.0060 vs $0.0115 for Wide JSON)
- For the `2024-08-06` model, strict mode was more cost-effective in all the cases

## Caveats

While strict mode is superior for more complicated cases, it has limitations that might be disqualifying it from using it in your case:

- Not all JSONSchema types & features are supported in strict mode. Things like `allOf`, `oneOf`, `not`, `definitions`, `min`, `pattern`, and **most importantly `format`** are not supported
- JSON can be nested only up to 5 levels and have up to 100 properties
- `additionalProperties` is not supported
- All fields are required (but you can make them optional by doing the `"type": ["string", "null"]` trick)

## My Practical Recommendations

Based on my findings, I recommend the following approaches:

1. **For Simple JSON Structures**:

   - Prefer non-strict modes, especially tool-based methods for speed and cost-effectiveness
   - Go with smaller mini model if you can (but don't forget about potential failures, wrap in try/catch accordingly)

2. **For Moderately Complex JSON**:

   - Use non-strict modes with more advanced models (e.g., gpt-4o-2024-08-06 with tool calls)
   - Always validate the output using Zod schemas

3. **For Highly Complex JSON**:

   - Strict modes are essential for reliability and success
   - Use the most advanced model available (e.g., `gpt-4o-2024-08-06` in Strict Mode)
   - Be prepared for very significant cold start penalties (goes away in the subsequent runs, neglible when running multiple times in a row)

4. **Cost Considerations**:

   - For simpler tasks, non-strict modes are generally more cost-effective
   - For complex tasks, strict modes can be more cost-effective, especially with advanced models
